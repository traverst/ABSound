# About This Comparison

This tool helps you find the optimal parameters for the voice model using a **User-Controlled Adaptive Strategy**.

## How It Works

The comparison process is divided into three phases to efficiently narrow down your preference:

### Phase 1: Explore (Blue)
*   **Goal:** Broadly explore the possibilities.
*   **Strategy:** The system presents sounds that are *most different* from your current favorite.
*   **Indicator:** The **Confidence** bar shows how much of the parameter space you've explored. When it's high (e.g., >80%), it means you've heard a good variety.
*   **Action:** Click **"Start Refinement"** when you feel you've explored enough.

### Phase 2: Refine (Purple)
*   **Goal:** Fine-tune your choice.
*   **Strategy:** The system presents sounds that are *very similar* to your current favorite (neighbors).
*   **Indicator:** The **Confidence** bar tracks how many times your favorite has won consecutively. A score of **100%** (5/5 wins) suggests you've found a solid winner.
*   **Action:** Click **"Start Showdown"** when you are satisfied with the winner.

### Phase 3: Showdown (Red)
*   **Goal:** Final verification.
*   **Strategy:** A round-robin tournament between the top candidates found during your session.
*   **Indicator:** The **Confidence** bar shows the progress of the final tournament.
*   **Action:** Complete the matches to see the final leaderboard.

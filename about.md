# About This Project

This tool allows for subjective A/B testing of voice model parameters.

## How it works
1. You will be presented with pairs of audio samples.
2. Listen to both and select the one that sounds more natural or closer to the reference.
3. The system will rank the parameter combinations based on your choices.
